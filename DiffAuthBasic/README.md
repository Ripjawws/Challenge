# KOIBANX Backend Challenge

## Introduction

> A REST API developed for a client that already has a Frontend. Currently, it has authenticated endpoints with BasicAuth, the data is returned paginated with a certain limit per page. When trying to add a new user a "unique" was added to make sure usernames don't match, when trying to add a new store the input data is validated with "yup" with a couple of required to make sure the basic information is covered.

## Considerations

> One of the considerations taken for this project was the data that needed the Frontend to display the table of stores with details correctly and correct user input when creating a new store. BasicAuth was put in place as specified in the documentation received by the client.


## Installation

>  To start this project make sure you have NodeJS:
```sh
npm i
npm start
```
